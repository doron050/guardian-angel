# Guardian Angel
Guardian Angel is the **Facebook Global Hackathon Finals 2018** 3rd place winning project.

## The app
Guardian Angel tracks the location of a person with Alzheimer's, Dementia or any other condition that can cause disorientation and getting lost. The app knows the user's safe locations (home, work, supermarket, library) and continuously checks that the user is close enough to at least one of these points. In case the user gets too far away from all points, it alerts a family member that the user may be lost, together with his live location.

In cases where the family member is close and can get to his relative quickly, that would be it. But in situations where some closer help is needed, this is where the guardian angels step it. Guardian angels are family members of users with such conditions that have the app and have experience in approaching people with Alzheimer's or Dementia. If a user is lost and is close to them, they will get a notification with all is important information. They can then find and assist him.

After competing with 20 other finalists from all around the world, Guardian Angel was nominated as one of the top 6 teams and qualified for a live presentation on Facebook's Hackathon page. 
After pitching our ideas to hundreds of people on site, and many more online, we won the third place and got a $2,500 big fancy check.
